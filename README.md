# Mean stack - front-end

This course is all about web applications using some very popular core technologies commonly referred to as the MEAN Stack. These technologies work together to form a Javascript driven environment that allows quick and easy development of both server web apps like a web API and client apps for browsers and mobile devices. In this course, I'll show you how to build for the backend and frontend with MEAN by creating a basic user discussion board. We'll take a look at setting up the hosting environment and installing the tools needed to develop there. Then we'll take a look at posting a form on the front end and processing it on the backend and finally storing it in the database.
